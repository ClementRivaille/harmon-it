# Harmon'it

Tool computing chords. Made to learn React Redux.

[View demo](https://clementrivaille.github.io/harmon-it/)

It is currently an unfinished product. Later features include playing notes with Web Audio API, displaying sclaes, and eventually composing random melodies. But I have learned what I wanted to know about React and Redux with this project, and I'm now working on other tools.

## Install
